# Incident Response Plan (IRP) – Portfolio Edition

**Author:** Umme Farva  
**Date:** September 28, 2025  

This repository contains my Incident Response Plan (IRP), developed to showcase my ability to design, structure, and document effective cybersecurity response strategies. It includes two detailed playbooks and two tabletop exercises, aligned with NIST, SANS, and ACSC guidance.  

---

## Overview
The IRP provides a structured approach to handling cybersecurity incidents:
- **Phases:** Preparation → Identification → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned
- **Playbooks:**  
  - Ransomware Incident Response  
  - General Cyber Incident Response  
- **Tabletop Exercises:**  
  - Malware Outbreak  
  - Ransomware on Finance Database  

This project highlights both **technical response steps** and **communication/coordination skills** critical for SOC and IR teams.
